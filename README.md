Investigating superspreader detection methods
---
This repo contains code and experiments about the results presented in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09524).
For this experiments a twitter dataset has been used about the spreading of COVID-19 in italy (Vaccinitaly).
To label the tweets creating a ground truth, [newsguard](https://www.newsguardtech.com/) scores has been exploited.
